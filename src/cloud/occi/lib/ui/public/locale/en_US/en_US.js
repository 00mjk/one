    "Welcome to OpenNebula Self-Service":"",
    "OpenNebula Self-Service is a simplified user interface to manage OpenNebula compute, storage and network resources. It is focused on easiness and usability and features a limited set of operations directed towards end-users.":"",
    "Additionally, OpenNebula Self-Service allows easy customization of the interface (e.g. this text) and brings multi-language support.":"",
    "Have a cloudy experience!":"",
    "Compute resources are Virtual Machines attached to storage and network resources. OpenNebula Self-Service allows you to easily create, remove and manage them, including the possibility of pausing a Virtual Machine or taking a snapshot of one of their disks.":"",
    "Storage pool is formed by several images. These images can contain from full operating systems to be used as base for compute resources, to simple data. OpenNebula Self-Service offers you the possibility to create or upload your own images.":"",
    "Your compute resources connectivity is performed using pre-defined virtual networks. You can create and manage these networks using OpenNebula Self-Service.":"",
    "This is a list of your current compute resources. Virtual Machines use previously defined images and networks. You can easily create a new compute element by cliking 'new' and filling-in an easy wizard.":"",
    "You can also manage compute resources and perform actions such as stop, resume, shutdown or cancel.":"",
    "Additionally, you can take a 'snapshot' of the storage attached to these resources. They will be saved as new resources, visible from the Storage view and re-usable.":"",
    "There are currently":"",
    "virtual machines":"",
    "The Storage view offers you an overview of your current images. Storage elements are attached to compute resources at creation time. They can also be extracted from running virtual machines by taking an snapshot.":"",
    "You can add new storages by clicking 'new'. Image files will be uploaded to OpenNebula and set ready to be used.":"",
    "Additionally, you can run several operations on defined storages, such as defining their persistance. Persistent images can only be used by 1 virtual machine, and the changes made by it have effect on the base image. Non-persistent images are cloned before being used in a Virtual Machine, therefore changes are lost unless a snapshot is taken prior to Virtual Machine shutdown.":"",
    "images":"",
    "In this view you can easily manage OpenNebula Network resources. You can add or remove virtual networks.":"",
    "Compute resources can be attached to these networks at creation time. Virtual machines will be provided with an IP and the correct parameters to ensure connectivity.":"",
    "networks":"",
